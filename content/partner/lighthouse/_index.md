## Introduction

Combining Azure Lighthouse and Partner Admin Link helps Microsoft to recognising the impact that your managed services have within customer subscriptions.

This has more importance with the changes to the partner program this financial year, and the focus on roles that are eligible for recognition.

These pages start with some theory to help you

* understand the partner program, criteria and partner attached ACR mechanisms
* dive deeper into PAL and Azure Lighthouse to understand the benefits and nuances

    > For those who want a little more detail (and links to the official Microsoft docs) then keep scrolling down.

Finally we will walk through some examples:

* a minimal config
* an expanded version with a service principal for Terraform deployment
* a more complex configuration with additional roles elevated via Privileged Identity Management

The examples use the Support Request Contributor role which is eligible for partner earned credit and therefore for PAL recognition in FY23.
