## Introduction

We have helped a number of partners to make the most of Azure Lighthouse and Partner Admin Link so that they are fully recognising the impact they have within customer subscriptions via their managed services.

This has more importance with the changes to the partner program this financial year as partners need to maximise their ACR to help achieve the partner score threshold.

The list of roles that are eligible for recognition is also changing this year and the Reader role will no longer be recognised for PAL partner attached ACR.

These pages start with some theory to help you

* understand the partner program, criteria and partner attached ACR mechanisms
* dive deeper into PAL and Azure Lighthouse to understand the benefits and nuances

    > Short on time? Just read the __In Brief section at the top and then jump to the next page.
    >
    > For those who want a little more detail (and links to the official Microsoft docs) then keep scrolling down.

Finally we will walk through some examples:

* a minimal config
* an expanded version with a service principal for Terraform deployment
* a more complex configuration with additional roles elevated via Privileged Identity Management

The examples use the Support Request Contributor role which is eligible for partner earned credit and therefore for PAL recognition in FY23.
