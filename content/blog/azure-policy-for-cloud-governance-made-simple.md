# Azure Policy for Cloud Governance Made Simple

Maintaining compliance and governance across cloud resources can be challenging as your Azure environment grows. Azure Policy provides a centralized way to enforce organizational standards and assess compliance at scale, making cloud governance both manageable and automated.

## Why Azure Policy Matters

As organizations migrate to the cloud and scale their operations, maintaining consistent standards becomes increasingly complex. Without proper governance:

- Resources may be deployed in non-compliant configurations
- Security vulnerabilities can be introduced accidentally
- Cost management becomes difficult without standardized resource sizing
- Regulatory compliance requirements may be violated

Azure Policy addresses these challenges by providing a declarative approach to resource governance.

## Core Concepts

### Policy Definitions
A policy definition describes the compliance conditions and the action to take when those conditions are met. These can be:
- Built-in policies provided by Microsoft
- Custom policies tailored to your organization's needs

### Policy Assignments
Policy assignments apply policy definitions to specific scopes such as subscriptions, resource groups, or individual resources.

### Policy Initiatives
Initiatives group related policies together to simplify management and assignment of multiple related governance requirements.

## Common Use Cases

1. **Security Compliance**: Ensure all storage accounts have encryption enabled
2. **Cost Management**: Restrict VM sizes to approved SKUs
3. **Naming Conventions**: Enforce consistent resource naming patterns
4. **Location Restrictions**: Limit resource deployment to specific Azure regions
5. **Tag Requirements**: Mandate specific tags for billing and organization

## Getting Started

The easiest way to begin with Azure Policy is to:
1. Review built-in policy definitions in the Azure portal
2. Start with audit mode to understand current compliance status
3. Gradually move to enforce mode for critical governance requirements
4. Create custom policies for organization-specific needs

Azure Policy is an essential tool for any organization serious about cloud governance and compliance. Start small, learn from the built-in policies, and gradually expand your governance framework.
