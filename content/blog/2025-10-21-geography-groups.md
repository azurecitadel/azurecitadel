An interesting little Azure Update popped up last week, as the Locations API will be switching its output for the UK, with the Geography Group changing from "Europe" to "UK".

{{< flash>}}
**[Generally Available: Locations API Update for UK Azure Regions](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates?id=513376)**

To align with evolving compliance and regulatory requirements, Azure is updating the geographyGroup and regionalDisplayName metadata for UK-based regions in the Locations API.

These changes will take effect this month, October 2025, and will apply to the existing UK South and UK West regions. It will introduce a new geographyGroup value: "UK", and the regionalDisplayName prefix will also be updated from "Europe" to "UK".

What customers will see:

- Updated values in Locations API responses for UK-based regions
- Revised region names in Azure Portal region selection menus

Here is how it looks today:

```bash
az account list-locations --query "[?starts_with(name, 'uk')]" --output jsonc
```

The geographyGroup in the metadata is gaining more importance as data and operation sovereignty controls tighten for public cloud, with the EU Data Boundary relating to the EU and EFTA regions.

Here is another useful command that shows all of the current physical regions as a table sorted by geographyGroup and geography.

```bash
az account list-locations --query "sort_by(sort_by(sort_by([?metadata.regionType == 'Physical'].{geographyGroup:metadata.geographyGroup, geography:metadata.geography, location:metadata.physicalLocation, displayName:displayName, name:name}, &displayName), &geography), &geographyGroup)" --output table
```

Feel free to check out the JMESPATH page for the syntax of the query above. Effectively it filters the array where metadata.regionType is physical, selectively creates new objects, sorts by displayName, then geography, then geographyGroup and outputs as a table.

(Copilot can be very useful in constructing more complex queries...)

Here is the resulting table in Markdown form.
