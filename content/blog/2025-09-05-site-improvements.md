I have made a few improvements - with more than a little help from GitHub Copilot - to the Azure Citadel site. It now has improved navigation, support for blog posts and more control over light/dark mode.

The aim is to make the site more usable especially when shrunk small or used in a Microsoft Edge sidebar. Now you can navigate to popular topics more easily whilst maximising the screen size you allocate to your workspace.

At the top you will always see the breadcrumbs, and when in "narrow" mode you can now use the hamburger to see the nav pane fly in. You will also have left and right arrows in the table of contents to move between pages in a series, and the navigation pane makes it easier to follow where you are. That table of contents will disappear in narrow mode, but you can always drop it down to jump to a specific header.

In addition I have added a couple of small icons at the bottom of the sidebar so that you can choose between light and dark mode. Previously it just followed the system setting. If nothing else it will make it easier for me to check that the content looks OK in both modes!

Finally, I decided to switch up the accent colour to a fetching share of seafoam green. Lovely.

Finally, image are now (finally!) full width, and if you click on them then you will see them in full resolution, with scrolling and alt text support.

I will also start adding a few blog posts for short one off topics, some key updates which are more partner focused, plus some odd things I find interesting working on Azure. This will allow me to retain the main content in the sidebar for the more structured multi-lab content that I know many of you find useful.

All of these changes were created iteratively with GitHub Copilot using the GPT-5 preview. For me this is where AI is great - I prefer not to use it to generate the site content as I prefer to use my own voice, but to work alongside me to accelerate what I would like to get done is a perfect use case. Agent mode is just amazing.
