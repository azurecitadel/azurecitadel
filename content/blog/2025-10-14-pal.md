A new set of partner guidance when configuring Partner Admin Link for recognition of their influence in providing services to customers.

I am pleased to launch the new [Partner Admin Link](/pal) area on Azure Citadel that I think will help address a common ask we see from partners:

  > _How do we correctly configure Partner Admin Link so that we fully recognise the positive impact we are having in customer accounts, and how do we avoid the pitfall of suddenly finding that recognition has disappeared with little explanation?_

Here you find an overview of Partner Admin Link and how it works as a mechanism that should dispel a lot of misunderstanding of what it is and assumptions on how it should work.

You will also find quick short cuts to common scenarios for configuring PAL, with users, guests, service principals, managed identities, Azure Portal, PowerShell, Azure CLI, REST API and GitHub workflows all covered at one point or another.

I also plan to add in more to this if I see demand. If you want to raise a scenario that I have not included then add it to the [Partner Admin Link discussions](https://github.com/azurecitadel/azurecitadel/discussions/132) page!
