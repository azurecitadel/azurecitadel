A new set of partner guidance when configuring Partner Admin Link for recognition of their influence in providing services to customers.

I am pleased to launch the new [Partner Admin Link](/pal) area on Azure Citadel that I think will help address a common ask we see from partners:

  > _"How do we correctly configure Partner Admin Link so that we fully recognise the positive impact we are having in customer accounts, and how do we avoid the pitfall of suddenly finding that recognition has disappeared with little or no explanation?"_

Here you will find an overview of Partner Admin Link that should dispel a lot of misunderstanding of what it is and assumptions on how it should work.

You will also find quick short cuts to common scenarios for configuring PAL, covering

- users
- guests
- service principals
- managed identities

configured with a mix of

- Azure Portal
- PowerShell
- Azure CLI
- REST API
 GitHub workflows

plus Azure Lighthouse as well. Whilst is is not an exhaustive list of the options, I'm confident that it is still the most comprehensive set that you will find.

I plan to add more scenarios to this if I see demand and any gaps based on your questions. If you want to raise a scenario that I have not included then add it to the [Partner Admin Link discussions](https://github.com/azurecitadel/azurecitadel/discussions/132) page!
