The alzlibtool is a useful tool when validating that your library will pass the checks used by the alz provider when reading in library references.
[
The tool is based on go, and the source and instructions can be found in the [github.com/Azure/alzlib](https://github.com/Azure/alzlib) repo. This [Linkedin post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jacktracey93_alz-weekly-question-week-2-2026-activity-7417952643869843456-lsrp) from the Microsoft Customer Architecture and Engineering (CAE) team includes a useful overview from its creator, Matt White. Scrub through to 9 mins remaining for the alzlibtool section.
