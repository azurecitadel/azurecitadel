## Azure Automanage

* Open Automanage in the portal
  * \+ Enable on existing machine
  * Open Advanced
    * Create new account: arc-pilot-automanage in uksouth
    * requires either Owner or User Access Administrator
  * Select servers
    * Filter to the arc_poc resource group
    * Select the six Azure Arc servers
    * Select Production
    * Select the arc-pilot-automanage Automanage account

Wait until the status shows configured. Some of the services will still take some time to come through.

## Update Management

* Find the Automation account created by Automanage

  From the Automation accounts page, open the new Automation account created by Automanage

* Schedule an update deployment for a weekly security update and full update monthly

  Select the Update management pane, **Schedule update deployment**.

  | Field | Value |
  |---|---|
  | Name | arc-windows-security-weekly |
  | Operating system | Windows |
  | Groups to update | Select your Subscription or Resource Group scope |
  | Machines to update | Leave blank |
  | Update classification | Security updates |
  | Include/exclude updates | Leave blank |
  | Schedule settings | Recurring every 1 week |
  | Pre-scripts + Post scripts | Leave blank |
  | Maintenance window (minutes) | 120 |
  | Reboot options | Reboot if required |

  Repeat these steps for other update classifications and for Linux operating systems.

* Report update compliance

  From the Update management pane, check **Machines**, **Missing updates**, **Deployment schedules** and **History** tabs.

* Trigger an update deployment and measure its success

  Reselect the Update management pane, **Schedule update deployment**.

  | Field | Value |
  |---|---|
  | Name | arc-windows-update-now |
  | Operating system | Windows |
  | Groups to update | Select your Subscription or Resource Group scope |
  | Machines to update | Type: Machines |
  | Update classification | Select all |
  | Include/exclude updates | `Set in at least 5 minutes time, to occur once |
  | Pre-scripts + Post scripts | Leave blank |
  | Maintenance window (minutes) | 120 |
  | Reboot options | Reboot if required |

  From the Update management pane, check **History** tab to check progress of the job.

## Inventory

* Find the Automation account created by Automanage

  From the Automation accounts page, open the new Automation account created by Automanage

* Review the software and services inventory

  Select the Inventory pane, check **Machines**, **Software**, **Windows Registry**, **Windows Services** and **Linux Daemons** tabs.

* (optional) Install additional software to an Azure Arc virtual machine, view the software in the Inventory

  Reselect the Inventory pane after software installation, and check **Machines**, **Software**, **Windows Registry**, **Windows Services** and **Linux Daemons** tabs. It may take 15-20 minutes after installation for the Software to be visible in the data.

## Log Analytics

* (optional) Write a Log Analytics query to report the installed Windows Updates and the needed Windows Updates on Azure Arc connected Windows virtual machines

  In the portal, navigate to **Log Analytics workspace** and open the workspace created by Automanage.

  Open **Logs** from General.

  Software update data is stored in the `Update` table. Type `Update` into the query and **Run** to see all data.

  To show just the `Installed` or `Needed` updates, the following queries will work:

  ```Kusto
  Update
  | where UpdateState contains "Installed"
  ```

    ```Kusto
  Update
  | where UpdateState contains "Needed"
  ```

  Summarize can reduce the information displayed, such as using a `count` of `Computer` or `count` of `Title` (name of the update).

    ```Kusto
    Update
  | where UpdateState contains "Needed"
  | summarize count(Computer) by Title, UpdateState, Classification, Product, MSRCSeverity
    ```

* (optional) Write a Log Analytics query to report the Python version on Azure Arc connected Linux virtual machines


  Inventory data is stored in the `ConfigurationData` table. Type `ConfigurationData` into the query and **Run** to see all data.

  To show just the `Software`, the following queries will work:

  ```Kusto
  ConfigurationData
  | where ConfigDataType == "Software"
  ```

  This query can be refined to show the Python data with a query such as:

  ```kusto
  ConfigurationData
  | where ConfigDataType == "Software"
  | where SoftwareName contains "python"
  | summarize arg_max(TimeGenerated, *) by SoftwareName, CurrentVersion
  | render table
  | summarize by Publisher, SoftwareName, Computer
  ```

## Azure Monitor Workbooks

* Create an update assessment Workbook to visualize update compliance and detail missing updates

  An `Update Assessment.json` sample Workbook is available in the GitHub Azure Monitor Community here: [https://github.com/microsoft/AzureMonitorCommunity/tree/master/Azure%20Services/Azure%20Monitor/Workbooks](https://github.com/microsoft/AzureMonitorCommunity/blob/master/Azure%20Services/Azure%20Monitor/Workbooks/Update%20Assessment.json)

  In the portal, navigate to **Monitor**.

  In **Workbooks**, choose **New** and **`</>` (Advanced Editor icon)**.

  Paste the contents of the `Update Assessment.json` template into the editor (replace any existing content within the input field). Check the **Template Type** is set to `Gallery Template`.

  **Apply** the changes, select **Workspace:** `(the workspace created by Automanage)` and **Servers:** `All`, then **Done Editing**.

  A preview of the Update Assessment Workbook will display and should be populated with compliance data. If not, check the **Workspace** and **Servers** scopes.

  Click the **Save** icon to save the Workbook, and consider whether to use the **Pin** icons next to each chart to save the charts to the Dashboard.
