## Introduction

This is a two day hack to get you skilled up in the various aspects of using Azure Arc to onboard VMs outside of Azure and leverage the management plane and range of services to transform how you manage your hybrid estates.

> The hack is used in the UK to enable partners and those partners will make use of Azure Passes with pre-created resources to accelerate the hack. You are absolutely free to reuse the content yourself as it is 100% public, including the repository used to create the "on prem" resources.

The hack is a challenge hack, so each section gives you a number of challenges to meet, plus a set of links for your reference. As you complete each section you will screen share with your proctor to confirm the success criteria has been met before moving on to the next section.
