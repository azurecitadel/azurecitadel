## Introduction

Your Azure Arc pilot requires a small number of Windows and linux servers. These will be your on prem machines. In later labs you will be onboarding these VMs as Azure Arc-enabled VMs.

As per the pre-reqs, the hack scenario assumes a pilot of:

* 3 x Windows Server 2019 VMs
* 3 x Ubuntu 18.04 VMs

**Either create your VMs outside of Azure (preferred), or using the provided Terraform repo.**

## Non-Azure

If you have access to another platform, e.g.:

* VMware vSphere
* Hyper-V
* GCP
* AWS

then feel free to create your VMs there. This will be a more realistic pilot.

Note that there is an [operating systems supported list](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-arc/servers/agent-overview#prerequisites) for Azure Arc.

The VMs will need outgoing internet access.

## Terraform repo

If you cannot create VMs outside of Azure then you'll create some onboardable VMs using a Terraform repo. The repo will create servers with no Azure Agent and firewall rules blocking the IMDS endpoint.

* Use the <https://github.com/terraform-azurerm-examples/arc-onprem-servers> repo's README file
  * You will need an [SSH key](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/linux/mac-create-ssh-keys) for it to work
  * Do not set the azcmagent or arc variables!
* Create the "on prem" virtual machines ready for the manual onboarding tasks
  * Review the content of the onprem_servers resource group in the Azure Portal.

This is not a Terraform training session so the readme file is intended to be usable by Terraform novices.

⚠️ **_Do not interact directly with the Azure resources in the onprem\_servers resource group!_**

  **These VMs represent VMs that exist outside of Azure, so think of them as on prem servers, e.g. VMs running in an ESXi cluster in a datacentre.**

  **You shouldn't configure anything in the portal or CLI that _directly_ accesses the VMs in the onprem_servers resource group az Azure resources, e.g. resetting passwords, installing extensions or applying policies.**

  **The only thing you should do with these servers is log into them using the Bastion service.**

Hint: You can also shut down these VMs in the portal when they are not needed so that they are deallocated and do not incur compute costs.

## Next up

You now have on prem servers. Next you will prepare a resource group to onboard them into.
