## Tasks

Should be simple enough as this is a gentle intro and not intended to challenge

If they have created VMs outside of Azure then great. Note that there are some limitations with AWS VMs.

If using the repo then the README in the [Terraform repo](https://github.com/terraform-azurerm-examples/arc-onprem-servers) is straightforward and complete. Keep referring them back to that.

Help them to create SSH keys if they are stuck. There is a link on the Citadel pages and the repo's readme.

## Success criteria

1. On prem servers
   * There should be both Windows and linux servers
   * They need to be on the supported list.
