## Who should attend?

This hack is designed specifically for Microsoft partners who are managing clusters or application development at scale. This could either be through a managed service or running their own software on hybrid or multi-cloud infrastructure.

You will be expected to understand at least the basics of Kubernetes but proctors will be available to help if you find yourself stuck. The challenges are designed to be open-ended and you should take the chance to explore different ways of solving the same problems.

The hack is separated into three different personas responsible for different areas however the hack is designed so that everyone can take on any of the responsibilities.

| **Name** | **Responsibility** |
|---|---|
| Cluster Administrator | Platform level infrastructure and cluster baseline |
| Application Developer | Deploying and running custom applications |
| Operations | Monitoring and ensuring cluster health |
