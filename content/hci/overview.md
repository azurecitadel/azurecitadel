## What is Azure Stack HCI?

{{< youtube id="fw8RVqo9dcs" autoplay="false">}}

## Advanced Specialization

The Microsoft [Advanced Specializations](https://partner.microsoft.com/membership/advanced-specialization) are there to allow partners to differentiate themselves based on the depth and breadth of their capability, and to give customers a level of confidence and assurance that they're choosing the right partner.

Partners are providing a variety of professional and managed services that leverage Azure Stack HCI and Azure Arc for hybrid scenarios.

The [**Hybrid Cloud Infrastructure with Microsoft Azure Stack HCI**](https://assetsprod.microsoft.com/hybrid-cloud-infrastructure-with-microsoft-azure-stack-hci1.pdf) advanced specialization covers the design and implementation of Azure Stack HCI, plus integration with Azure Arc services. The pdf includes the program requirements.

Note that the last page of the document includes a link to a fuller document with the audit criteria and FAQ.

## Partner Hack

We intend to create a partner hack covering

* architectural design
* cluster deployment
* cluster registration
* Windows Admin Center
* Azure Arc integrations
* AKS cluster deployment

Watch this space!

## Azure Arc

Azure Stack HCI is designed with Arc integration in mind.  and many hybrid services will take advantage of their complementary features as they are better together.

Check out the Azure Arc section to find out more about the additional configurations possible for the VM sand container based workloads running on your HCI clusters. Also includes information for the Azure Arc advanced specialization.
