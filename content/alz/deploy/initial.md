## Overview

On this page you will:

1. Locally clone the repo generated by the Azure Landing Zone accelerator
1. Add the alz provider

    Use the alz Terraform provider to pull the library definitions from the [ALZ Library](https://aka.ms/alz/lib) repo. You will learn plenty more about the alz provider and libraries throughout these labs, but for now we'll just pull the most recent release of default definitions.

1. Update the variables.tf and add a main.tf to your Terraform config

    Add a config based on the examples provided for the Azure Verified Modules in the Terraform registry.

1. Locally test your config will pass the CI tests

    The CI workflow will test that your config meets minimum standards, and will pass the format, will initialise the providers, and passes the validation. You will also test it will create a terraform plan.

    Override the backend with a terraform_override.tf file and test locally.

⚠️ You **must not** attempt to run terraform apply locally at his point. You will use the CI/CD workflow in the next page instead.
