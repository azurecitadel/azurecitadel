## Overview

On this page you will:

1. Locally clone the repo generated by the Azure Landing Zone accelerator
1. Add the alz provider

    Use the alz Terraform provider to pull the library definitions from the [ALZ Library](https://aka.ms/alz/lib) repo. You will learn plenty more about the alz provider and libraries throughout these labs, but for now we'll just pull the most recent release of default definitions.

1. Update the variables.tf and add a main.tf to your Terraform config

    Add a config based on the examples provided for the Azure Verified Modules in the Terraform registry.
