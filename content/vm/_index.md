## Introduction

Virtual machines are well covered in both Microsoft Learn and the Microsoft Docs, so that should always be your first destination when going deeper with compute on Azure.

With our focus on automating at scale, we find there are a few areas where the documentation doesn't go quite deep enough. Therefore we'll add in a few labs here based on the work we do with partners. If they prove popular then we'll contribute directly to the Microsoft Docs and if that contribution is successful then the page weill disappear from here!
