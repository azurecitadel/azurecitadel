## New labs!

**Finally! We have some new labs for Terraform 1.x and the 3.x azurerm provider.**

Explore the fundamentals series to get to grips with some of the Terraform basics.

## Planned

The intention is to add to these. Current planned set is:

* bootstrapping example environments e.g.
  * Cloud Shell
  * Windows Subsystem for Linux + Visual Studio Code
  * Share production (remote state and service principals)
  * Config management server (Packer, Azure Compute Gallery, Managed Identity, Bastion)
  * CI/CD with GitHub
  * CI/CD with Azure DevOps
  * CI/CD with Terraform CLoud
* modules
  * using
  * creating
  * publishing
* advanced syntax (e.g. for_each, dynamics, objects, provisioners, templates etc.)
* calling REST APIs using provisioners

Some will work as a series, whilst others will act as reference material.

Is there something specific you would like to see? Add a reply to the [discussion](https://github.com/azurecitadel/azurecitadel/discussions/7#discussioncomment-326980) and we'll take a look.
