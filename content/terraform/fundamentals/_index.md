## Overview

This is a set of short and simple labs to introduce you to the Terraform workflow, the basics of the HCL file format and where to find documentation for the azurerm provider types.

## Pre-reqs

Everything will be run within the bash version of the Azure Cloud Shell which already has Terraform installed and maintained for you, so all you need for these labs is an active Azure subscription.
