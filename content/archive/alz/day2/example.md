## Introduction

There are a number of requirements in the Azure Barista's scenario that force you to deviate a little from the default management group structure, as defined by Azure Landing Zones. You will also need to create some additional custom policies to meet the customer's specific needs. This is a very common thing to do after you have run through a design workshop.

On this page we will run through an example structure and explain the reasons why these decisions have been made.

## EA enrolment and AAD tenants

The EA Structure should look similar to the below:

## Identity and access management

- The existing Azure AD Tenant of: ```azurebaristas.onmicrosoft.com``` will be used as:
  - Already synced with the On-Premise Active Directory Domain: ```azbaristas.local``` via Azure AD Connect with Password Hash Sync & SSO configured
  - Used already for Office/Microsoft 365 services across the organisation
- A single Azure AD Tenant is recommended as part of Azure Landing Zones & [CAF Security best practices](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/security/security-top-10#9-architecture-standardize-on-a-single-directory-and-identity)
- Relevant RBAC role/custom roles defined and applied as per RBAC requirements on the [Day 2 Challenge Page](../customise/#security-group-and-rbac-assignments) & [Day 1 Azure Baristas Intro](/alz/day1/baristas)

## Management Group Structure

The Management Group structure should look similar to the below example:

## Network topology

- Azure Virtual WAN should have been chosen as the networking technology
  - Due to the desire for moving towards SD-WAN
    - Also Citrix skills within the networking team and Citrix being an Azure Virtual WAN partner
- Also due to a lot of branch sites (Coffee Shops) required and the flexibility and speed Azure Virtual WAN will give Azure Baristas
- A Azure Virtual WAN Hub per Azure Region to be deployed in the Connectivity Subscription in a single Resource Group:
  - UK South
  - South East Asia
  - Germany West Central
  - UAE North
  - East US

## Management and monitoring

- All logs will be sent to a single Log Analytics Workspace deployed in the Management Subscription

## Business continuity and disaster recovery

- Azure Policies (whether built-in, custom, or imported from Azure Landing Zone) in place as per backup requirements listed on the [Day 2 Challenge Page](../customise/#policy-guidance) & [Day 1 Azure Baristas Intro](/alz/day1/baristas)

## Security, governance and compliance

- Azure Policies (whether built-in, custom, or imported from Azure Landing Zone) in place as per all other requirements listed on the [Day 2 Challenge Page](../customise/#policy-guidance) & [Day 1 Azure Baristas Intro](/alz/day1/baristas)

## Platform automation and DevOps

Not currently in scope for the Azure Baristas scenario.
