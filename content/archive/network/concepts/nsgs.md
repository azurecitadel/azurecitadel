## Lab Overview

In this lab, we will see how to create network security groups. Network Security Groups enable restricting flows at a subnet or at a virtual machine’s network interface level. We will create rules and apply at a subnet level. We will also see how application security groups are applied.

### Lab Diagram

## Create application security groups

An application security group enables you to group together servers with similar functions, such as web servers.

1. Select + **Create a resource** on the Azure portal
1. In the **Search the Marketplace** box, enter Application security group. When **Application security groups** appears in the search results, select it.
1. Click **+Add**. Enter, or select, the following information:

    | **Setting** | **Value** |
    |---|---|
    | Subscription | Select your subscription |
    | Resource group | Select **rg-lab** from the dropdown |
    | Name | **mgmt** |
    | Location | **West US 2** |

4. Click **Review+Create**
5. Once validation passes, click **Create**
6. Repeat steps 3, specifying the following values:

    | **Setting** | **Value** |
    | ---|--- |
    | Subscription | Select your subscription |
    | Resource group | Select **rg-lab** from the dropdown |
    | Name | web |
    | Location | **West US 2** |

## Associate ASG to network interface

1. In the Search resources, services, and docs box at the top of the portal, begin typing virtual machines. From the search results, select **Virtual machines**.
1. Select virtual machine **vnet1-vm-mgmt1**
1. Under **Settings &rarr; Networking &rarr; Application security groups**, select **Configure the application security groups**, select **mgmt** for **Application security groups**, and then select **Save**
1. Repeat steps 1-3 for virtual machines **vnet1-vm-web1** and add application group **web**

## Create a network security group

1. In the _Search resources, services, and docs_ box at the top of the portal, begin typing _Network security group_. From the search results, select **Network security group**.
1. Click **+Add**. Enter, or select, the following information.

    | **Setting** | **Value** |
    |---|---|
    | Subscription | Select your subscription. |
    | Resource group | Select **rg-lab** from the dropdown. |
    | Name | **nsg1** |
    | Location | **West US 2** |

1. Click **Review+Create**. Once validation passes, **Create**.

## Create security rules

Create a security rule to allow SSH and RDP to the management servers.

1. On the network security groups page, click on the network security group **nsg1** you just created.
1. Go to **Settings &rarr; Inbound security rules** and click **+Add**.
1. Enter, or select the following values, accept the remaining defaults, and then select **Add**:

    | **Setting** | **Value** |
    |---|---|
    | Destination | Select **Application security group** |
    | Destination Application security group | **mgmt** |
    | Destination port ranges | 22, 3389 |
    | Protocol | TCP |
    | Priority | 100 |
    | Name | allow-mgmt-access |

1. Create another security rule that allows http and https traffic to the web application security group.

    | **Setting** | **Value** |
    |---|---|
    | Destination | Select **Application security group** |
    | Destination Application security group | **web** |
    | Destination port ranges | 80,443 |
    | Protocol | TCP |
    | Priority | 120 |
    | Name | allow-web |

# Associate network security group to subnet

1. On the **Network security groups page**, click on the security group **nsg1**
1. Under **Settings**, select **Subnets** and then select **+ Associate**
1. Under **Associate subnet**, select **Virtual network** and then select **vnet1**. Select **Subnet**, select **vnet1-subnet1**, and then select **OK**.
1. Repeat step 3 to associate to subnet **vnet1-subnet2** from **vnet1**

## Verify NSG for the virtual machine

1. Go to the virtual machine vnet1-vm-mgmt1.
1. Got to Settings &rarr; Networking.
1. Check the network security group nsg1 is applied to the subnet vnet-subnet1.
1. You will also see another security group  vnet1-vm-mgmt1-nsg attached to the network interface of the virtual machine. This was created when you created the VM and assigned Basic network security group as default configuration setting. You can go ahead and disassociate this security group from the network security group as we now have one applied at the subnet level. Note the name of the security group.
1. Click on the network security group attached to the interface.
1. Go to Settings &rarr; Network interfaces.
1. Click on the three dots … on the right and click Dissociate.

    ![Disassociate](/network/concepts/images/lab02-02-disassociate.png)

1. Repeat above steps for each VM created with a basic network security group

## Verify Security rules

It’s time to see the rules in action.

### Connect to the management server

1. From your laptop, SSH to the management server
1. SSH to vnet1-vm-mgmt1 using its public IP address
1. Verify you are successfully able to login

_Which rule enabled ssh access?_

### Connect to the web server

1. From your laptop, SSH to the web server
1. SSH to vnet1-vm-web1

_Are you able to reach the login prompt? Which rule was used for this flow?_

## Conclusion

We learnt how to configure network security groups and application security groups to protect your compute instances in Azure.

## Challenge

Complete additional flows as given in the diagram below to restrict traffic further within your virtual network. Make sure only this traffic is allowed.
