## Introduction

This scenario is for when you no longer have the secret or cert for a service principal, but you do have permission to create or modify pipelines or workflows in your CI/CD platform. These commonly use service principals when interacting with Azure environments. Historically they would have the client secret stored as a pipeline secret whereas it is now increasingly common to leverage OpenID Connect (OIDC) using a federated workload credential.

### Check the subject in the federated credential

With OpenID Connect the service principal uses a federated credential to define the trust relationship to another identity provider and the context in which that is valid. This is far more secure than having a client secret that may be used for manual authentication, exactly as shown in the section above. (Removing the maintenance overhead of rotating secrets is another benefit.)

1. Open the [Entra admin portal](https://entra.microsoft.com/#home)
1. Open Entra ID > [App Registrations](https://entra.microsoft.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_RegisteredApps/ApplicationsListBlade/quickStartType//sourceType/Microsoft_AAD_IAM)
1. Click on **All applications**, filter the app registrations using the displayName or appId / clientId, and select
    ℹ️ If you don't know the appId then you can search the [Enterprise apps](https://entra.microsoft.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/StartboardApplicationsMenuBlade) for the service principal's objectId and retrieve the appId from there.
1. Click on **Certificates and secrets** to view the federated credential's **Subject identifier or claims matching expression**

The subject identifier for the example is repo:azurecitadel/my-terraform-workload-repo:ref:refs/heads/main, so OpenID Connect will only succeed for workflows run from this repository's main branch. Here are the most common entity types supported for GitHub.

|Entity Type|Example|
|---|---|
|Environment|repo:azurecitadel/my-terraform-workload-repo:environment:prod|
|Branch|repo:azurecitadel/my-terraform-workload-repo:ref:refs/heads/main|
|Pull request|repo:azurecitadel/my-terraform-workload-repo:pull_request|
|Tag|repo:azurecitadel/my-terraform-workload-repo:ref:refs/tags/v1.0|

After examining the federated credential, you can determine where the workflow needs to be run from to be successful.

If your service principal is set with a client secret then you can skip the step checking the federated credential. Customise the workflow to match [Azure/login's service principal secret](https://github.com/Azure/login?tab=readme-ov-file#login-with-a-service-principal-secret) guidance.

### Create and run a workflow

This step assumes you have the permissions to create, commit, and run workflows that meet the subject criteria in the federated credential.

1. Create a new branch, e.g. `pal`
1. Create a new workflow, e.g. `.github/workflows/pal.yml`
1. Add in the example YAML workflow

    {{< modes default="Azure CLI" >}}

```yaml
# Partner Admin Link using the Azure CLI with OpenID Connect

          - Delete
        required: true
      partnerId:

        inlineScript: |
            az extension add --name managementpartner
            az managementpartner ${{ github.event.inputs.action == 'Create' && 'create' || 'delete' }} --partner-id ${{ github.event.inputs.partnerId }} --output jsonc
```

```yaml
# Partner Admin Link using PowerShell with OpenID Connect

          ${{ github.event.inputs.action == 'Create' && 'New-AzManagementPartner' || 'Remove-AzManagementPartner' }} -PartnerId ${{ github.event.inputs.partnerId }}
```

    Check your GitHub Actions secrets and variables in your GitHub repo's Settings > Secrets and variables section. The workflows are preconfigured for common Terraform environment variables.

    - Change the prefix from `vars` to `secrets` if they are defined as secrets.
    - Change the names if required, e.g. `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`

    The workflow is set for manual deployment. Feel free to change the [trigger](https://docs.github.com/actions/reference/workflows-and-actions/events-that-trigger-workflows).

1. Commit and push the new branch
1. Create a pull request and merge to the main branch
1. Click on **Actions**
1. Select the **workflow**
1. Click on **Run workflow**
