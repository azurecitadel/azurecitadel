## Microsoft Learn

The first port of call is the Azure Learn documentation which includes a [PAL FAQ](https://learn.microsoft.com/partner-center/membership/link-partner-id-for-azure-performance-pal-dpor#frequently-asked-questions-about-a-pal-association) section.

Selection of the questions:

- Who can link the partner ID by using a PAL association?
- Can a partner ID be changed after it's linked through a PAL association?
- What if a user has an account in more than one customer tenant?
- Can other partners or customers edit or remove the link to the partner ID?
- Which partner ID should I use for the PAL association if my company has multiple?
- Where can I find influenced revenue reporting for a linked partner ID?
- Why can't I see my customer in the reports?
- Does a linked partner ID work with Azure Stack?
- How do I link my partner ID if my company uses Azure Lighthouse to access customer resources?
- How do I explain a PAL to my customer?
- What PAL data does Microsoft collect?
- Does a PAL association affect the security of a customer's Azure environment?
