## Overview

This security-focused module introduces several techniques for securing a SaaS offer webhook and then dives into code looking at implementations of the techniques presented. This module builds on the concepts and code presented in the module, “[Implementing a Simple SaaS Webhook in .NET](../video13)”.

Although utilizing an Azure function built in .NET, topics are presented in such a way as to be architecture and technology stack agnostic.
