## Overview

See the SaaS Fulfillment REST API in action as we send it through its paces using Postman. Youâ€™ll learn how to authenticate with Azure Active Directory, resolve and activate subscriptions just like your Landing Page does, and see many other features of the API.

This module prepares you for working with the language-specific client libraries.

This modules requires you to have knowledge of [Application Registrations in AAD](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app).

An Application Registration is used in the examples when making the first request to retrieve an authentication token from Azure Active Directory. You should be familiar with creating an Application Registration and finding the following information in the Azure Portal.

1. The [Tenant ID and App ID](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal#get-tenant-and-app-id-values-for-signing-in)
1. A [Client Secret](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal#option-2-create-a-new-application-secret) on the Application Registration
