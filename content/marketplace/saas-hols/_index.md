## Introduction

The *SaaS offer* differs from the *Virtual Machine offer* and *Azure App offer* as no resources are deployed in the customer subscription. As such, the publisher must charge both for the software licence and the underlying Azure resource costs used to deliver the solution. *SaaS offers* can be listed in both the *Azure Marketplace* and *AppSource*.

## Content

These learning modules are designed to help you speed your time to publish your SaaS offer to the Microsoft commercial marketplace.

These labs are meant to be done sequentially. They build on one another, so begin at the beginning to walk through all the labs.
