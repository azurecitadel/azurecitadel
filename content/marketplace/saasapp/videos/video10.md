## Overview

In this module we examine the elements of building a simple landing page and looking at how it works.We examine the following topics.

* The purpose of a landing page
* A humble landing page in action
* The code
* Available data to display

The technology stack used is C#, ASP.NET MVC, and Razor views, just to keep it simple. We use the [SaaS Client Library for .NET](../video9) to build out our landing page functionality.
