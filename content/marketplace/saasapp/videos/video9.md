## Overview

This module introduces the [SaaS Client Library for .NET](https://github.com/microsoft/commercial-marketplace-client-dotnet) developers who want to work with the SaaS APIs at a level of abstraction above the REST level.

The client library is a fully functional .NET package that you can [install from NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Marketplace.SaaS.Client) and use in your applications.

This video shows a sample command line application that can talk to the client library API and the code is available in this repository via the link above.
