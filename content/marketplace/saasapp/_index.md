## Introduction

The *SaaS App offer* differs from the *Virtual Machine offer* and *Azure App offer* as no resources are deployed in the customer subscription. As such, the publisher must charge both for the software licence and the underlying Azure resource costs used to deliver the solution. *SaaS App offers* can be listed in both the *Azure Marketplace* and *AppSource*.
