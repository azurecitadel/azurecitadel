*Virtual Machine offers* are used to deploy and transact a virtual machine (VM) instance through Marketplace. The solution must consist of a single VM. Anything more complex requires an *Azure Apps offer*.

When a customer 'purchases' a *VM offer*, the VM will be deployed into the customer's Azure subscription. As a consequence, VM offers can only be published in *Azure Marketplace* (not *AppSource*).

*VM offers* support the *Transact* listing type. They also support the *BYOL* listing type. A *Test drive* option is also available.

Transact *VM offers* are billed on a usage-based PAYG (Pay As You Go) model. Each plan can be created with a free trial option giving you the option to offer customers a 1 / 3 / 6 month period with no licence fees.
