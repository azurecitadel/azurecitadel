## Introduction

The *Azure Apps offer* is used to deploy and transact a more complex solution than a single VM. *Azure Apps offers* can only be listed in *Azure Marketplace*, not *AppSource*.

The *Azure Apps offer* has two distinct flavours; *solution template* and *managed application*.

* The *solution template* offer is a collection of Azure resources described by an [Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/overview) which will be deployed into the customer subscription. It is not directly transact-capable but it can deploy *VM offers* which are transactable.

* The *[managed app](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/managed-applications/overview)* offer is a collection of Azure resources described by an [ARM template](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/overview) deployed into the customer subscription to be operated as a managed service.

In this lab we will focus on the *Managed Application* flavour of *Azure Application offer*.

When a customer 'purchases' a *Managed Application offer*, resources will be deployed into the customer's Azure subscription. As a consequence, Managed Application offers can only be published in *Azure Marketplace* (not *AppSource*).

Transact *Managed Application offers* are billed either a flat monthly rate or using [metered billing](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/azure-app-metered-billing) or a combination of the two.
